# CardSearch

##app for searching a magic the gathering card databse and viewing them

###REST calls
###JSON
###Collection Views


search for cards and view them in a collection using magicthegathering.io's api

final functionality yet to be decided. this is initially a project meant to help me become more 
comfortable with rest calls, parsing json and using collection views. 


Most of the code will be refactored to some degree. Right now Im just trying to get core functionality working
while feeling out what features I do or dont want it to have
