# CardSearch

##app for searching a magic the gathering card databse and viewing them

###REST calls
###JSON
###Collection Views


search for cards and view them in a collection using magicthegathering.io's api

final functionality yet to be decided. this is initially a project meant to help me become more 
comfortable with rest calls, parsing json and using collection views.
