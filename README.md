search for cards and view them in a collection using magicthegathering.io's api

Currently one can configure several different parameters to search through magic the gathering cards and browse the card. these cards can be saved to a favorites collection. Most of the heavy lifting is done and im beginning to focus on optimizations and UI/UX. Search parameters still need to be finalized. The core app should be ready for release soonish. From there I might add extra features.
